How does scissoring work?,Are Molly Haas (pz) and Wes Haas (po) related?,Nope!,I still use my high school's databases for research papers. Not my fault they never changed the password.I'm starting to fall back into it again, it's been so hard to fight. Sometimes I think that if I let myself slip, everything would be easier, there would be no more pain. But after years of just pushing through, deep down I have never been able to do that, as painful as it is always thinking about it. I have everything I could want, and yet there's still this knot of emotional pain that sits in my chest, goading me whenever times get tough. I'm starting to lose my sense of self and reason for living again, but I'm too scared to ask anyone for help.,Asking for help was a very important step for me to finally grow as a person through my depression. If you're scared to ask for help, that is understandable. You are not alone in that. Message me if you want to talk about help on campus and in the community.:), I was told the other day that I radiate a sort of ethereal and care-free brand of happiness. I bashfully took the compliment because I didn't have the heart to let them know how off base they were. In reality, my version of a happy disposition is a mask I wear for the few people who care about me; I think they need me to be alright. I love them, so for their sake, I play along, but it scares me to realize just how good I've become at keeping up the facade., After a while, you might start to believe it. Either way, you go for keeping strong! :), I hate camping. I like being able to shower everyday and have access to electronics. I'm all for spending a day in nature, but days at a time?? 				What's wrong with you people?, n it's almost as if different people have different desires and different things make them happy., I don't know about you, but I love peeing in nature.,we crazy,don't yuck my yum!, Ariel, A while ago I was walking behind some people discussing whether or not they believed soul mates where a real thing. They decided they were not. I just wanted to tell you that I used to think the same thing, until I found my soul mate., Divya,uuuure.,Awwwww,taaaaaahhhhp, '), Why aren't there more cute guys here. All the ladies are hot.., I've never had boyfriends or girlfriends, only lovers., ok, There are easily way more attractive guys than girls at the 5C's . Step your shit up ladies, I could not disagree with you more!, lol as if, Hahaha dream big, no one wants to step up anything for you probably, Ouch. Try being less picky or look elsewhere., To the girl that stole my grey sweater with the sharks on the pocket who goes to Mudd and looks to be Asian, please return it to CMC ( give it to Beckett dorm). Thanks. Otherwise I'll track you down, cause I know what you look like and I know what your friends look like. Shit. PEACE., I thought we were going through another earthquake, but then I realized no, it's just Pitzer droppin' the bass.,Charles Horin, To the guys in the matching striped shirts on the third flood of the library giggling like the cackle of insane hyenas in the Lion King movie (apparently that's what you call a group of hyenas), you're hot. Jk you guys are possibly committing a capital offense. Everyone knows that the first floor is for eating, the second floor is for Facebooking, the third floor is for quiet breathing, and the fourth floor is for silent sobbing. Keep it down boiz, I can't hear the sound of my own breathing over your hyena mating calls, \Silent sobbing\, You're wrong, it's the fourth flood. The third flood of the Library was in November 2011., I hate when my girlfriend forgets our promise long time ago., You've been watching too much anime...., The conveyer belt for used dishes at McConnell just makes me so happy for some reason.

I realized on our drive that four out of five of us have been sexually assaulted to different degrees. And all four of the guys who assaulted us have had no consequences. What is wrong with the world...?,This is why reporting is so important. Guys think they can get away with it, and apparently they can; we need a more vindictive system., ( I know, almost everyone has a story... it sucks., How do I approach women?

For those of you who might worry about a date going badly, here's some advice: please go on dates more often. The only way to learn is to practice. It doesn't even need to be all that serious - ask someone in a class out to dinner or something, and just be chill about it. If you think someone is interesting, just hit them up sometime for dinner or coffee. You'll learn how to act on dates if you do. Then, when it really matters (if you really are interested in someone), you won't be nervous at all. No one is born being an expert at dates; and Claremont is a perfect place to practice, since there are so many people here who would love to finally have some romantic experiences., Truth, Do people care about age gaps? I'm pretty young and I'm interested in someone who is a bit older than me, but not by a whole lot. I don't mind, but I'm worried that they would instantly friend zone me because I'm young, Keep in mind the Cougar Rule :P Half your age plus 7, or minus 7 from your age and doubled if you're looking for someone older. It's not necessarily a rule to live by as people have different comfort levels around the manner, but I feel like it's a good starting guideline. If you meet someone you like and you're worried about the age difference but they fit the rule it could help you to stop you worrying about the difference as much. But really, if you're okay with it and the other person is okay with it, that's all that matters., i mean, if you're 18 and they're 19, for example, it's really not a big deal... I wouldn't care about any age gap you might find between people here at the 5Cs because people tend to be more similar than dissimilar, and its not like you're going to find someone who is 5+ years older than you here. The only reason why I would worry about dating a senior as a freshman, for example (assuming you connect really well as people), is that things will be tough when he/she graduates and you're still stuck in school. I think you should just go for it! Don't let something this small worry you.,Why do people have to be so mean all the time? I understand that you've got your own problems to deal with but seriously folks - calm your fucking tits for just one fucking second and understand that you're not the only person on this fucking planet who is going through something,I'm thinking about coming out. I've come out to a few friends already. The reception has been interesting.,Just maxed out my credit card. Oops. Annnnd I don't have a job either...so now I'm wondering how I'm going to get money for textbooks...,1) Get the list of all required texts off the Huntley site once you've decided what classes you're going to be taking.2) Go to Honnold-Mudd on a day when you have five or six free hours.3) Find all those books, if they exist, in the library. Order the ones that don't from Link+.4) Stand in front of the copy machine near the second floor Mudd Services Desk and scan each page of every required text, after having entered your email address into the machine. When finished, send the files.5) Return the books.6) Either read them on your computer, or print pages from them as necessary, from the print quota of your college.This is completely legal, according to a loophole in the copyright act of 1976 that allows the duplication of printed materials for personal, educational use.#representing #my #social #class #justalittlebit,^ I'm not OP but omg you're brilliant Hunter,Thank you? Also, I forgot a little step. You should always scan one page of each book and email it to yourself first, to make sure the machine scans it properly. If it doesn't, reduce the percent size and change the paper size from Auto to 11\ x 17\.,Returns,I am a troll. I live under a bridge. This bridge is called Claremont Confessions.,I heard from a friend that same sex couples can finally have kids together - that they can do things to the sperm's or egg's genetic material to make them into the other type of cell or something (possibly inserting the DNA into an empty sperm or egg?). Anyways, as a homosexual myself this idea makes me so excited! I suppose I've been consigned to think that it would be impossible to have kids with the person I love, but if it were really possible, I want that to happen so badly! I could think of nothing better!,next step: uterine replicators so that PREGNANCY IS A THING OF THE PAST, I tasted the best cum the other day. It tasted like cream soda.,What is his diet?,I want to take care of someone. My life has always been about me up to this point, but now I've grown to the point that I want to take care of someone else for a change. I want someone to nurture, care for, and to make happy. I want to make someone laugh. I want to surprise someone with cute thoughtful gifts. I want to give someone wild sex whenever they want it. I honestly was the most selfish person in the world until recently. I'm not sure what changed, but I'm glad it did. For once, I feel like I'm alive. Like I have a purpose in life greater than myself.,Question for the guys out there: If you married someone who made a shit ton of money (way more than you), would you be okay with being a house-husband? I'm personally attracted to the thought of marrying a guy who could be a house-husband. I have a pretty solid career lined up for myself, and it would be wonderful to just come home to a clean house at the end of the day, have dinner made for me, and then have amazing sex afterwards. I could provide a life of luxury for us both - he could be able to do whatever he wants, as far as hobbies or passions are concerned. I'd be totally fine having hired help to do the cooking and cleaning as well. It would be a totally comfortable life. Assuming these things, never having to worry about money, always having whatever you want to keep you happy, and a devoted spouse who provides for you - would you be interested in such a life?Or would it feel empty? Would you want to go work? Is it wrong of me to want a stay-at-home-husband?,I grew up with a stay at home dad, and he is the absolute best. (He prefers the term \homemaker\). He taught me how to use a table saw and bake chocolate chip cookies. He served on PTA and led my middle school reading circles. He built my sister and I the most badass pink playhouse you could imagine in your wildest dreams! My mom was the lawyer who brought home the proverbial bacon (my dad brought home literal bacon because he did the grocery shopping). He is a wonderful parent as is my mother, and I was lucky enough to grow up in a gender flip-flopped household and I remained entirely unconscious of its rarity until I hit middle school. So as for the sheer concept of being a stay at home dad, hell yeah! It can be great for the whole family and in this day and age I'm sure even more people would be willing to try an atypical family set up. However a word of caution: in this description, you make this theoretical man sound like your pet! Or perhaps a maid. A \kept\ man is very different than a husband and partner. My parents relationship worked because they are BOTH devoted to each other. Because they BOTH provide for each other, be it financially or emotionally. A good relationship is fundamentally a partnership of equals and if you can maintain that, than whether or not one of you (male, female, plant, or mineral) decides to stay home it can be a positive experience! But always remember, there is more than one way to \provide\ in a relationship and NEVER underestimate how long it takes to clean a house, especially if your got little rugrats running around. (Kids are mysteriously sticky 90% of the time). Good luck in life and love! Stay open to options! Be flexible! And be responsive to your partner's needs! Long live love <3,I’m down,this is my back up plan just in case this whole college thing doesnt work out,Some of my guy friends have expressed a desire to be house husbands, so it's definitely a thing that appeals to at least a some people :),Sounds very appealing,Yes I fully support this.,I would be so down.,thats my dream job,Sounds like a win-win situation to me.,Michael White Jacket Galathe Robby Figueroa lol,So down.,I want to be a house husband.,Where can I sign up?,i wish there were more of you,You're not by any chance interested in running for President or Vice President, are you?,In our patriarchal society, it is possible that you will have more difficulty finding a house-husband than a, well, non-house-husband. But do not, even for a moment, confuse challenge with impossibility.,I cheated on an exam. I'm stressed about grad schools, and I'm just not smart enough to get the grades I need. This first year of college has been really rough on me, and I've figured out that I'm not academically on par with the rest of my peers. And so, in order to do well, I cheated. This is the first time I've ever cheated on anything. I've never even cheated on a homework assignment before. I think I'm going to cheat my whole way through college. I have no other choice. I can't compete with my peers through brains, so I just need to find some other way to make do.,\It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\- Albus Dumbledore,I'm not sure what school you go to, but I think they all have a lot of resources to help you out. It's easy to be deterministic about intelligence and give up, but there's so much more you can do, and it will be worth it. After college, this is a mentality that will hold you back more than grades ever could. I hope you can turn it around. Good luck OP!,If you can't get by in college and do well enough to get into grad school, what makes you think you'll do well in grad school? You can't cheat your way through everything, just do the best you can and see where it gets you.,I understand it can feel intimidating to be here sometimes. I feel that way too at times, but how about considering a tutor?,I realised today, that I am actually a figment of my best friend's imagination...and I'm not actually real. It's kind of sad really, because that means that my best friend is only imagining all of the good times we've had together. I hope he doesn't take his medication, because I don't want to disappear. I want to be with my friend forever!,Look, you're hot enough to be a porn star...but if you want me, you're going to have to come and get it. I'm busy becoming a billionaire, and the only distraction I'm interested in is you.,i'm sure it must be a privilege and an honor to date you,Shout out to all the AWESOME introverts out there! Introverts are the best, seriously. We have a deeper understanding of ourselves and our actions, so we excel at so many things as a result of this increased perception. Also, we are more sensitive to people around us, so we are better at friendships since we can realise when people are going through tough times, and be able to help them out. The list goes on and on, but the short of it is that we are fucking amazing. <3,Introverted pride! Now leave me alone, I'm reading.,nd so humble!,I was super attracted to this person over spring break, but I'm starting to lose my initial attraction because this person hasn't initiated anything (I'm the only one initiating).

Props to you for initiating .,I've found the perfect person. Not only is this person HELLA FUCKING SEXXXY, but this person is also the biggest sweetheart I've met. Literally, the sweetest person ever. I feel so lucky to have found someone so amazing! I would write this person a claremont compliment, except that I don't want anyone else to find out about this person - I want this person all to myself!,I'm kind of an asshole.,DO NOT bring your car to Claremont.

This vulnerability has recently felt like it's been taking over my life, and it's pretty awful. What the fuck has happened to me?,I can relate.,I think most of the people here are a bunch of bleeding hearts who get offended about anything and everything. Terms like \privilege\ and \trigger warning\ have no place in civilized conversation.,terms like \civilized\ have no place in decent, respectful conversation.,I share the sentiment, but I have to disagree about lumping \trigger warning\ in with the rest. PTSD is a real thing that ruins lives, a lot of things can cause it, and if we can avoid making things worse for people affected by it we should. Besides, its like 3 extra words at the beginning of a post. Not a big deal.,\civilized conversation\,I've been crushing pretty hard on this person I've only known peripherally.

Lately I've been wanting to pursue relationships with women but I'm afraid my friends, most of whom are women, would look at me differently if they knew I wasn't attracted only to men.,I want to affirm your feelings and your hesitation. Taking that step is big, and it is possible that it will change your relationships. On the other hand, your friends may surprise you with better reactions than you were hoping for. Obviously I don't know your friends and even if I did, I couldn't say for certain what their reactions would be. But yeah reactions to being bisexual can often be very different to reactions to being gay, especially in terms of potential microaggressions. Take care of yourself!,I occasionally practice chew and spit. I'll do it if I'm eating junk food or cookies or sweets or pizza. I'm aware that this behavior is worrisome, wasteful, and gross.

Good for you.,For everyone who looks at those of us who \do everything\ and are \super successful\...stop comparing yourself to other people. We aren't any better than you. How do you measure success in life? The answer to this question will also be your answer to why you aren't happy. Seriously, shut the fuck up for a second and think about what you need in life in order to be happy. Now go DO IT. You don't have to be happy now, but if you don't try to get there somehow, you're a fool. Life shouldn't be about money or power or any of those things. Figure out what you need to be happy in life, and get it.For me, I need someone to love and take care of. I'm going to be rich, sure...but what good is it to have millions of dollars and be completely miserable? Success isn't everything kids. When you're stressing about some stupid internship, instead take a moment to consider whether or not the path you are following will lead to happiness.It was that realization that made me want to change. I knew that if I kept up the way I was working, that I would never find happiness in the end, even though I would be assured millions. And then it was a hard decision, but I'm trying to give up some of what I'm doing in order to pursue what's most important in my life.I'm overtired, so maybe this is all gibberish...I hardly sleep anyway...but I hope that maybe if this post even helps just one person who experiences the same conflict as me, then it's worth it.,'Money can't buy happiness, but it can make you awfully comfortable while you're being miserable.' — Clare Boothe Luce,Not only did they try to intentionally choose unflattering pictures of each of these celebrities, but I personally think they all look more beautiful in their natural state. :),I'm happily single for the first time ever.

I can even believe it. You’ve never raped anybody. You would NEVER rape anybody. You’re upset that all these feminists are trying to accuse you of doing something or connect you to doing something that, as far as you’re concerned, you’ve never done and would never condone.And they’ve told you about triggers, and PTSD, and how one in six women is a survivor, and you get it. You do. But you can’t let every time someone gets all upset get in the way of you having a good time, right?So fine. If all those arguments aren’t going anything for you, let me tell you this. And I tell you this because I genuinely believe you mean it when you say you don’t want to hurt anybody, and you don’t see the harm, and that it’s important to you to do your best to be a decent and good person. And I genuinely believe you when you say you would never associate with a rapist and you think rape really is a very bad thing.Because this is why I refuse to take rape jokes sitting down-6% of college age men, slightly over 1 in 20, will admit to raping someone in anonymous surveys, as long as the word “rape” isn’t used in the description of the act.6% of Penny Arcade’s target demographic will admit to actually being rapists when asked.A lot of people accuse feminists of thinking that all men are rapists. That’s not true. But do you know who think all men are rapists?Rapists do.They really do. In psychological study, the profiling, the studies, it comes out again and again.Virtually all rapists genuinely believe that all men rape, and other men just keep it hushed up better. And more, these people who really are rapists are constantly reaffirmed in their belief about the rest of mankind being rapists like them by things like rape jokes, that dismiss and normalize the idea of rape.If one in twenty guys is a real and true rapist, and you have any amount of social activity with other guys like yourself, really cool guy, then it is almost a statistical certainty that one time hanging out with friends and their friends, playing Halo with a bunch of guys online, in a WoW guild, or elsewhere, you were talking to a rapist. Not your fault. You can’t tell a rapist apart any better than anyone else can. It’s not like they announce themselves.But, here’s the thing. It’s very likely that in some of these interactions with these guys, at some point or another someone told a rape joke. You, decent guy that you are, understood that they didn’t mean it, and it was just a joke. And so you laughed.And, decent guy who would never condone rape, who would step in and stop rape if he saw it, who understands that rape is awful and wrong and bad, when you laughed?That rapist who was in the group with you, that rapist thought that you were on his side. That rapist knew that you were a rapist like him. And he felt validated, and he felt he was among his comrades.You. The rapist’s comrade.And if that doesn’t make you feel sick to your stomach, if that doesn’t make you want to throw up, if that doesn’t disturb you or bother you or make you feel like maybe you should at least consider not participating in that kind of humor anymore…Well, maybe you aren’t as opposed to rapists as you claim.”- via a comment on shakesville.com,Sometimes I feel like the lone socially awkward fish in the Claremont McKenna sea of socially adept/normal people,[Depression]It's been half a year and here I am, still depressed and obsessed with you. It's unhealthy and it's killing me but it's not like life is important anyway. It's whatever,^no,I like your attitude,I literally can't stop crying.,Looking around in class, I don't see many girls who fit my style. Many don't care about school and many care way too much. When I go to parties, there's a sea of insecure, shit-faced girls. Their counterparts are in dorm rooms, over-studying and over-worrying. I'm looking for a girl who is smart and well-read, one who could contribute to an intellectual conversation without having to prove her intelligence. I'm looking for a girl who's funny in her own right, who can quote Seinfeld and appreciate a good off-color joke. I'm looking for a girl who is beautiful and confident, who maintains her self-respect without crossing into the territory of a prude. I'm looking for a girl who has professional aspirations but still plans on raising a family. Do you know this girl? Anonymity breeds curiosity, so who am I? I'm bright, humble but also wary of false-modesty. I'm really funny, when I want to be; a lot of people have borderline-retarded senses of humor, so there's no point wasting time on them.

Whenever I get involved with someone I always shy away afterward, rejecting them even though I don't want to. I'm just scared. Even my closest friends know so little about me, although they think they know me so much. When I get home drunk, I often cry to myself and tell myself that I'm worthless, that I suck, and that I wish nobody cared about me so I could just die. I've accepted that my far-flung future is in my imagination and I will probably die far before I reach it. I am apathetic towards my own death and often wish that I would just painlessly die in a way that noone would have guilt over my death. But everyone sees me as happy and emotionally stable. In reality, I hate myself, I cut myself, and I wish no one even saw me because then I could let myself die. As it stands, I can't, because I don't want anybody to be sad over my death. I am keeping myself alive to satisfy the people who don't know me at all but for some reason love me. But I have no love for myself and nobody who has come close to knowing how messed up I really am has any love for me either.,No one but you is preventing your death, so don't say \I can't,\ because you can. Now, the only philosophical question is to be or not to be. If you want a hint toward the answer: don't live for other people. You won't laugh while they're entertained, you won't be proud when they succeed, you won't be bitter while they suffer, you won't cry when they grieve.,I think that when I was in the womb and when my parents had sex that I sucked my dads dick,Please google \human anatomy\ and reconsider.,I'm reminded of South Park's version of that \The Aristocrats\ joke. I can't post it here in good consciousness, but google it if you have a strong stomach. This So, my boyfriend and I have a deal. He can have anal sex with me if I can put a dildo in his butt. Does this seem fair? We haven't reached an agreement and he doesn't want to do it because it doesn't necessarily provide pleasure for either of us (understandable). I don't really like the idea of anal but I'm all about experimentation, I just want us to both equally have to deal with the fear and pain that may come with having a foreign object in your butt for the first time ever. Please, no opinions from radical people who are down with everything. We're experimental but still pretty normal sexually. I just want opinions from people who consider their sex life pretty average (not average like meh, just average as in pretty in line with most other peoples). DISCLAIMER: this is not to say that I have any problem with a radical and crazy sex life, I just simply want opinions from people who are similar to me so I can relate with them.,You actually could get a lot of pleasure from it, as long as you are sufficiently aroused and you give each other cues throughout the process about what feels good and what doesn't. Anal sex is 100% \normal\ as you say, statistically, for heterosexual couples, it's just that people don't often talk about it. Like Eva says, rimming and using fingers first is a good way to warm up, and arguable necessary foreplay for anal sex. Please don't just ram objects into places on your body for the hell of it. Sex is supposed to be enjoyable and about enthusiastic consent! Lots of great comments on this thread about the female perspective which I think you might relate to! Have fun and be safe!,First of all, relationships are not business deals. It's about give and take, but it shouldn't be about keeping score or trying to retaliate. If there's something you're not comfortable with, talk to him about why. And talk to him about why he wants it in the first place. If you're open to trying something new anyway, then talk about your potential concerns with your partner beforehand and then go for it. If there's something you want to experiment with, talk to him about it. But don't experiment on him just because it seems like a way to keep things \fair.\,Hunter that's not necessarily true. Some women do enjoy anal sex. OP I'd say if you're open to anal go ahead and try it. The worst that can happen is that you don't like it and you choose not to do it again. I also think it's totally fair for you to want your bf to go through something similar cause it can be pretty uncomfortable and it might be good for him to understand what it's like for you especially if you guys decide you like it and want to keep going.,Ok idk if I fit the category of people that you want opinions of but I think I have a pretty reasonable suggestion: Why don't you guys start by rimming each other (not gross if you thoroughly shower before) or with just a finger each? It's a lot more manageable, not painful if you take it slow, and can give you guys an idea of whether you want to experiment further,I back up Spencer on this one. Whether or not he admits it, the dildo AND entering you will please him, while neither will please you (since you don't have a prostate). It's your sex life, but I'd reevaluate quand même.,I don't have a problem with dress codes, but I don't like that they always seem to be focused on not making girls' clothing \distracting.\ >:(,Every time I read Claremont confessions I wonder which ones are about me. About us. I wonder if you've ever tried to communicate with me through here because you know how obsessive I am about reading them. Our friendship fell apart.

An hour later, no response whatsoever.There's a problem here.......,Sometimes, I prefer not to eat than have to go to the dining hall by myself.,Sometimes, I prefer not eating rather than having to go to the dining hall with other people.,This semester has been pretty tough for me. At first I thought it was because of stress from classes and other responsibilities, but coming back from spring break has made me realized that I'm really just lonely. Even though I'm surrounded by people who care about me, I don't feel like I connect with them at all. I feel that I won't make it in Claremont because of how shitty I've been feeling, and that's really fucking scary., This semester has been pretty tough for me.

Inside, those few words triggered an emotional explosion of sadness, pain, and fear back to the last time I heard those words.

Your eyes give me butterflies whenever I look at your profile picture and then I can't focus. :\\ <3,It's so annoying that none of the girl's I've hooked up with here have given me head without me asking.

I simultaneously need to cry, and absolutely can't.,I'm here if you need; I went through the same thing last spring, so I can definitely empathize with what you're going through there. *hugs*,I recognize this is probably unhelpful, but in all honesty, if you need someone to talk to about that, I'm your girl. I'm sure that you have friends who could empathize, too - crying is totally reasonable in this instance. I'm really sorry about your cat.,(,Is there a page or app or group which I can join to keep track of the nightlife in claremont?

Dear new RA, it is so not necessary to plant yourself in the lounge and say hello and ask how I'm doing EVERY SINGLE TIME I walk through. You're friendly. Point taken the first 20 times.,Woah, let's turn that frown upside down,I pleasure myself with a vacuum cleaner.,Is 13 bras too many bras to own? I only actually wear 3 of them and sometimes the strapless one. I don't want to get rid of my other bras though because many bra stores do not carry my bra size.,Yes, that is too many. You will have to turn 10 of them in.,It's fine. Maybe leave some at home if you don't have enough space at home.

Help?,Cheating is breaking the rules of your relationship. If you're unsure of what those rules are, you should probably figure that out with your partner first! It always sucks to bring up things that could ruin the immediate interactions you have with your partner, but in the long run it's better to bring up doubts like these sooner rather than later. If you stay together, this will strengthen your communication and trust; if this breaks you up, then you probably weren't going to work out long-term anyways.,Talk to your SO?,I think she is the most underrated it girl of the Pomona sophomore class. She gets everyone's attention yet I know so little about her. Waiting for a time when I can \accidentally\ meet you, you glamorous mystery girl.,Hi Claremont peeps! This may seem like a hack, but I 1,050% promise that it is not. My favorite iPhone game EVER is called Scramble With Friends and recently it has lost popularity (at least amongst my Facebook friends). Basically, what I am wondering is: is there anybody else out here who is a fellow avid scrambler? If so, it would be AWESOME if we could be scramble buddies.

I don't feel like I have the same kind of community I did back then, and I really, really miss it. Seeing current sponsor groups together, laughing, being silly, fountaining people, it really makes me wish I had that again. Somehow I feel like I missed some sort of memo--all of my friends seem to have moved onto a new kind of community and I feel like I simply left one behind. And now it feels too late, and I feel really alone.,I feel you. After first-year, there's no real sophomore hall other than Oldenburger.

That includes drinking that casually starts at noon, not eating which pretty much starts whenever I feel like I'm spiraling out of control, and smoking which I've yet to admit to anyone that I've ever started at all. It gets better (often through pretending that nothing has ever been wrong to begin with) ; but this time I can't pretend that I'm alright because I finally don't believe that I am. My bright future seems more like a looming threat and the bottom of my tumbler feels much more secure to me than any real plan I've made for my time after graduation. Cheers to bad habits at 2:45 on a Monday afternoon.,I'm going through the same thing right now. Believe me, I know how you feel. Message me if you want to talk!,Today I wore leggings instead of underwear. I feel so free.,In response to MY SPONSOR GROUP SUCKS: OP: You have the right to vent just as much as anyone else and don't have to be eloquent or classy or explain.

Fuck them.,So I have a lot of friends who are obsessed with Natalia Poklonskaya...am I seriously the only person who doesn't understand the appeal? Seriously, what's so great about her!?!,It's a meme.,I've been seeing a lot of news about her - I think it's just the hype from the annexation of Crimea, and that there's this huge internet segment that thinks she's hot. So, she's good looking, she is dangerous (just played a hand in annexing part of a country in the 21st century), and she has firm resolve. I'm sure that lots of good guys would be interested in a woman who is all that and more; as opposed to a subservient housewife...,Pomona problems: Screwing the lid of my Nutella jar on so tight to keep out ants it strips the plastic threads.,But ants can't open jars...,Spray a continuous stream of Raid along the baseboards of your whole room in the morning, open the window, and then stay gone all day.

Nothing wrong with online dating. You do you. :),I think there are always a few gems.,I want to be set up with someone on campus. Someone should make a Claremont matchmaking service for their thesis.,At first I thought this said that there should be a service that matched people based on their theses, and I was so excited.,I came back from break realizing that I only want to be friends with two people once I graduate. and I can't honestly bring myself to care that much.,Is there anyone at the 5Cs thinking more about what's actually going on in our world instead of school? {Star Child Society},Who is this Bunnyman people speak of?,The proper title is the bunny guru,I think Beyonce is overrated, but everyone seems like they would bite my head off if I said so. Maybe she's a good role model of a strong, capable woman, but I find a lot of her music strident and annoying. She doesn't deserve all the worship she gets.,Someone doesn't like the music of a black woman for reasons independent of her sex and race? Must be a racist and a sexist. Even after admitting she is a good role model. Unbelievable...,Strident is a great word,So yeah, HvZ is starting again. I hope ya'll have your fun. Just please remember that not all of us want to hear about it 24/7.

And I'm not talking about the opinion page. I'm talking about the front page articles. It's excellent writing, but just so blatantly biased.,There is no such thing as an unbiased news source.,I'm the guy in charge of assigning those articles, so message me/shoot me an email at news@tsl.pomona.edu if there's anything else you want to share!,I like big butts and I cannot lie,I want you to want me.,I need you to need me.,Just thinking about going back to Claremont tomorrow after the break is overwhelming and makes me want to cry,In general I feel like the concept of \senior class gift\ involves a lot of uncomfortable guilting by these schools to make you give back after you're already paid a huge amount for your education. But this year I'm particularly uncomfortable with Scripps' use of the Bekki Lee Memorial Fund as a motivator to get more people to give. It feels a little bit like they're trying to capitalize on students' affection for this amazing woman that we lost unexpectedly, and while I know the money is going to a good cause, it still leaves a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth.,I had sex in my roommates bed over break because his bed is more comfortable.,You know I had a threesome planned for your birthday but it didn't seem like you needed my help getting another girl in bed. We still had fun with out you.,He plays in the Claremont lacrosse team. He had the most fantastic tasting semen ever. Are all lacrosse players like this?

I'm a bit relieved.,Yes, I realize that you and I are not exactly on speaking terms, and no, I don't really want to talk to you again. However, I hate to think that I am the one who is responsible for you not coming to dances on Saturday nights. I remember how much fun you had at them, and it makes me kind of sad that you've stopped going because you're avoiding me. If you were to come to them again, I wouldn't ask you to dance, or even interact with you. I just want you to know that I do still care about you and want you to enjoy yourself.,I find this confession a bit contradictory. You claim that you don't want to talk to this person ever again and yet you still care about them? I'm a bit confused,I am having a surprisingly difficult time avoiding the sight and sounds of my roommate masturbating in our room. I am not uncomfortable with him jacking off while he is alone in the room. However, he frequently begins in the morning before I have left for my 9:30 class. I tend to wake up and rush out the door once I realize what is happening (he usually avoids eye contact but continues). Amazingly, when I return from class at 11:00, he is more often than not still in bed, still masturbating. In another common scenario, I step into the bathroom to brush my teeth, and when I return there is motion under the sheets and quiet but audible moaning coming from his laptop. It is possible he is not totally clear on the american taboo against masturbating with company (he is a foreign student). Another concern is his resistance to using headphones when he watches porn. It has caused a good deal of tension in the suite, and my suite mate's girlfriend is now uncomfortable visiting. The first time I brought this up with him he started crying, so I am afraid to confront him again. Also, he is generally a very clean and courteous roommate, and aside from this point of contention we are a very good fit (I hope to room with him next year).,Crying or not, try to tell him to shape up again. You have the right to live in a safe space. If you don't tell him anything, he has no idea what he's doing bothers you.,Challah for Hunger once made \maple-bacon challah\,I don't go to Pitzer but am interested in taking Portuguese there next year. Does anyone have any experience with this class/professor?,I have been collecting photos / text messages / evidence of scandalous things people have been doing.

I plan on using these things to blackmail people in the future. :),Asshole,#justfelonythings,i both love and hate my roommate sometimes. recently i felt that i've only been using him as a go to. in group settings he is so awkward that i feel like he is my burden and responsibility. i sometimes just really hate him but don't know how to tell him that him quirks are so embarrassing and uncomfortable,I got screwed over by a guy who only wanted to take advantage of me when i'm drunk. i feel so lost and unhappy. someone please help make it go away,I'm so sorry that happened to you, if you'd like someone to talk with, feel free to message me privately (I'm an Advocate) and/or get in touch with either Pomona Advocates for Survivors of Sexual Assault or Scripps College Advocates for Survivors of Sexual Assault.,I believe wholeheartedly in materialism. People come and go from our lives, but a flatscreen TV doesn't give a shit about how you look today - it will always be there for you.,I'm usually quite liberal and pro-equality in a number of respects, yet i must admit, i am very occasionally overcome with an animalistic-like loathing for \the simple folk\, and feel that I owe them nothing and that they in turn deserve nothing. Where does this stem from?,nimalistic-like seems redundant,I have the same bra size as claremont compliments.,[TW: Disordered Eating]I want to start purging again, but I can't without all of my friends realizing something is up. It's starting to get to the point where food feels disgusting in my stomach, so every time I get hungry I eat until I feel sick for hours and then I hate myself the rest of the day.

I love deep discussions about anything and everything, and of course who doesn't love the occasional poop joke or two.

How do I 1) find queer women and 2) not objectify and use their sexual orientation?,don't think of it like experimenting. if you're thinking along these lines you've probably caught feelings or at least felt physical about a girl before. but liking ladies doesn't mean you would necessarily enjoy hooking up with literally any/all ladies on the planet (or at the Planet!), even queer ones, yeah? so do your sexy thing with a girl who makes you feel something, whenever that opportunity arises, even if it's awkward and weird and the feelings don't last or make any sense and nothing works. the way to not use someone (anyone) for their sexuality is to treat them as individuals instead of as part of some monolith of sex or gender where everyone's interchangeable. best of luck/welcome to team bisexual, maybe xoxo,Explain this to the potential partner.

And some of those people end up \dropping pre-med.\ The assumption that only the people who \really want it\ \make it\ just isn't fair, Some people realize that there are other things they want to do that don't line up with medical school, others lose their drive, and that shouldn't make you think their pre-med aspirations were any less compassionate, or had any less reason behind them, than another's.,To say that only people that really want it make it does not mean that all those who really want it definitely make it.,If you \lose your drive\ how much do you really want it?,I think people naturally and instinctively gravitate to a sense of religion and an afterlife.

Thanks!,If it's work study it shouldn't be taxed... look at the W-2 they sent. You shouldn't have any amounts under the \taxes\ sections. Therefore no need to file - you won't even get a return.,You do not have to file taxes. You may want to though for a tax return. CMC had a thing where people were helping students file for free but i think its over. There's a nearbyish HR block but that is kind of expensive for something that's going to be relatively simple. You can google other tax preparers or do it yourself. The form you would fill would be the simplest to understand. Hope that helps. :),People tell me they see me as strong and confident. But it's not that I can handle what I'm going through, it's that I don't feel comfortable confiding in anyone.It's lonely being strong.,It's difficult to go through hardship alone. Even if you can make it through alone, it's really best if you have someone to share the burden with. It's certainly easier for people to say this - the hard part is finding someone to help be there for you. But I assure you, in times where situations are emotionally overwhelming it's best to have someone who can help support you. Ask for help, or find someone who can endure with you. I'm not sure what sorts of struggles you are going through, but also know that you aren't alone. We believe in you OP. And there are many of us here at the 5c's who may be able to relate to your struggle; and we're here for you if you need us!,I was so drunk last weekend that I tried to buy a lap dance at the strip club with Flex.,To the cunt who stole my favorite pen in Harwood: Return that immediately or I will hunt you down and kill you.

Pretty sure she's also against queer/same-sex marriage. Yet she happily consumes queer caricatures that don't necessarily represent real people. Ugh.

To be specific does anything at Pitzer or any of the other 5Cs allow someone uncomfortable with their body to slowly be comfortable with that atmosphere because I see nudity as beautiful and not simply sexual. The fact that students here can feel comfortable showing their body makes me have such a high respect for them. I want to participate, but at first just hang out with them so I can feel comfortable being around other people who express themselves. If anyone can tell me more I would greatly appreciate it. I heard of the motherfucker party but I was not able to go, plus don't like to drink so I don't go to parties often, but I love interacting with people, so if anyone can tell me about more opportunities, I would greatly appreciate it!

Damn reflexes always swiping to the left.,How to stop procrastinating? (serious tips please),Stop reading CC.,What percent of women would you estimate use a dildo? I am very curious.,There's someone really important to me also here at the Claremont Colleges. She's somewhat like my partner. We do everything together, we live together, and we've known each other for a really long time before college too. When one of us is struggling (and we reverse roles), we carry the weight of the other even when it's really tiresome and hard. It's a mutual thing, I don't think we would be able to make it without each other. But right now, I don't know what to do or how to handle it any more. Last year, while I was abroad, she was diagnosed with a learning-related disability, but things came to a head when she couldn't keep up with schoolwork. She's grown dispirited. She's gotten accommodations, she's starting on anxiety meds and Ritalin, and she's gone to Monseur and other behavioral psychologists (but it's hard to do all of this when she still needs to be a student full-time and maintain her social connections). She quit working so she could focus on giving herself more space and time when she needs it. She's gotten to a point where she won't touch major assignments or stuff she views as challenging any more because it gives her so much anxiety or discomfort. The thing is, she's smart. But school is torturous for her. Writing assignments and managing her workload are difficult for her, and she can't handle it any more. I don't know how to tell our friends that she was considering dropping out of school over winter break, when she took out extensions for all of her classes for the major assignments she didn't start by finals week. We talked about it, and she doesn't want to go home - she would rather try and finish her degree.. But she's become aversive and cynical. She internalizes a lot of frustration because she doesn't understand why things are like how they are instead of being like how she thinks it should be- whether her essay assignment or how society should be (on a related note, she's gone through a lot of personal shit). And she's really hard on herself, regardless of what disability people say she has. Everyone keeps on telling her she should try to change her perspective, but she doesn't know how to change her perspective from something she instinctively feels is right by her view. Things like how they are, I feel are untenable. How is she supposed to go on with school when she can't even work on essays that have been past due? She gets upset easily; she will cry several times in a day instead of working on her essay because she can't bear it; she will be vent in bed instead. But there's no sign anything will change if she goes home, and tries to finish her degree later; both of us think it's likely she'll just grow more depressed and angry without managing to make productive use of her time there, and she has a tense relationship with her mother. It's wearing me down too, and I wish I had someone to talk to about it. I think of our friends and mentors we should rely on, and I try to reach out, but each time it's hard. We've never been that close with others, and dealing with our own issues, we've grown distant from others, our connections have been lost and it's hard to break down barriers when they're busy with their own things going on. So I just try to tough it out without talking to anyone, but sometimes it's really hard for me too. So... I wrote a confession.On that note, does anyone know what the Disability Resource Center can do? I know it's new - is there anything they can offer that can help in this instance?,This sounds like a really tough situation. Like Natalie said, the Student Disability Resources Center is going to open next fall, so unfortunately it's not a resource available now. I'm going to echo Natalie's comment that you and/or your friend might be interested in coming to DIDA meetings - we're the 5C disabled students organization and there are members who will be able to relate to your situation. If you ever feel like coming, either now or in the future, we'd love to have you!,I'm sorry to hear that. The Disability Resource Center is going to open next fall - it's going to help centralize academic accommodations and provide a physical space for students with disabilities to come together. The Director of the DRC might be of help, but Maddy Ruvolo knows more about that. The club that I'm part of is called DIDA (disability, illness, and difference alliance) and it meets every wednesday night at 8pm in the Scripps GJW living room! All are welcome and it'd be great to see both of you there if that's what you're interested in (:,Natalie Yau is VP of Dida - might be able to offer some guidance =],Beneath my surface of softness and passivity, fanciful dreams and trusting thoughts, lies something hard and bright and clear. I was that other, softer person once but the heat of the flames altered my nature irreversibly into it's new form. My pain could give birth to a universe. My flickering tongue spins superficial lies as my eyes stare hard into the darkness of truth and the words of the wise burn within my soul. There is only one truth. The truth is true in all true tests. Many liquids resemble water. Nothing but water is water. Stop believing what you want to believe, because that is a form of denial of the truth. Seek the truth honestly.,My boyfriend beats the shit out of me while we have sex, and I love it.,i wonder how many of my friends know i'm an alcoholic,Why do Black people call each other Monica?

Best party I've been to! That baby making music at the end though <3,You should know that what your doing is wrong. You may feel like a gentleman for pretending to care, but really, its a pretty dick move. I don't need your middle of the day texts checking in on me if all you want to do is fuck. Really, I'm a big girl, and I do this all the time, despite how you might perceive me. If I describe all the things you do all my friends tell me you must like me, but then, once they know who you are, they tell me that there is no way you do. I didn't know your reputation before all this started, so now I just feel like a fool for thinking you ever might have wanted something more, but then again, how is it my fault for not knowing your reputation? Thats on you. You have to many girls falling all over you and I really don't think you give a single fuck about me. So what's your endgame? I wish I just knew what you wanted from me so I could give it to you and we could both move on, but instead here I am still guessing. I shouldn't still think about this but I can't seem to figure you out.,To the guy who asked us to join us two at Señoritas BLOC, sorry we didn't respond. We talked about it quickly first and said we should say yes. But when we looked again, you disappeared,The reason why I haven't settled down into a relationship is because I can't find someone physically attractive enough. That's shallow, I know, but it's the truth. I have dated and talked to some amazing girls here but I simply can't settle down because I just am not attracted to them physically. Let's be honest here, you know what I mean.,I confess that when someone tells me that they are \kind of Christian but not really\ I automatically lose respect for them. You are or you aren't. If you are religious, you fucking go balls to the wall with that shit. If you're not or you simply don't know, then don't claim to! Saying you're a Christian is a big fucking deal. What you believe in is something enormously important if it were true.If you truly believe in God then that should be the center of your every choice and every thought. So stop half assing that shit, it's fucking annoying. People need to stop putting questions of religion in the background. Religion is important and it seeps in the cracks of literally everything. Everyone should really just sit and think about what they believe in and be honest with themselves. BE HONEST. What you believe in is subject to change, that's fine. Just recognize this. Don't just fling around the term Christian or Muslim, if you identify as these then respect that and truly follow them. It's fine if you're trying to find your way, that I can respect, but most of these people just don't put any thought into it. Pay attention to it! Religion can be a force for good but it can also be a force for great evil. Take it seriously. Religion is a big deal.Love,Slightly exasperated and annoyed atheist,Religion is also something that has many shades of meaning for different people. Identifying \as Christian\ signifies a wide variety of things to different people; those who are \kind of Christian but not really\ may be trying to express that their conception of Christianity may differ from the mainstream, or from that of any specific person/group. \Kind of Christian but not really\ is probably the best and clearest way for them to express their beliefs - it's not the same thing as being a devoted Christian or an agnostic or simply not knowing or whatever. \People need to stop\ policing the religious beliefs of others - yes, religion is important, and it's also very personal. Identifying with something less passionately than you do or differently than you would is not \half assing that shit,\ it's almost certainly their attempt to honestly express to you what they believe. I'm also totally at a loss for why you, an atheist, feel you have the right to say \if you truly believe in God then that should be the center of your every choice and every thought\ - I'm pretty sure that's something for those who DO actually believe in god to decide for themselves. Love,A similarly exasperated atheist,\If you are religious, you fucking go balls to the wall with that shit\= the exact stereotype that prompts people to say they are only \kind of\ Christian, Muslim, whatever...,I actually think that we should just dump the excess use of \kind of\. It's supposed to make people sound nuanced, but it just makes people sound vague. And afraid to say anything substantial (then again it's not the only thing that makes it seem like people never have anything substantial to say....),I'm an atheist too, but I think people can follow religions to any degree they want. People are entitled to take the aspects of a religion that are meaningful to them and not believe in the rest of it. Identifying with a religion doesn't necessarily mean basing every decision in your life on it.,I'm sure a party with red cups and popcorn would be quite the buzz on campus.,I'm having an affair with the lunch lady.,Riddle me this, you atheist fucks: If god isn't real, why does the sun RISE in the East, as in EASTer, when Christ ROSE again?,I did not think you mattered at all untill you were gone.

Also, that appearances should not trump over accomplishment, which is exactly what seems to have happened when so-called \feminists\ criticize Barbie's appearance for the billionth time.,But yeah, OP, you should not be shamed for being very conventionally attractive any more than fat people should be shamed for not being conventionally attractive.,If I encountered anyone who looked like either of those dolls, I would probably run away screaming.,Yeah, dolls really shouldn't have unrealistic proportions!

I am confident if he had to live on his own he would surely die considering he can't even properly feed himself. This poorly written rant is cathartic whew. :),Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man,Claremont people, let's all meet up in Miami if you're going to Ultra!,Dear Claremont,You can't delete that shit you said. Sincerely, Shut up,Gravity was not that great of a movie. Sure the visuals and the floating in space sequences were awesome to look at and effective, but the mediocre script, forgettable acting, and the slightly cheesy/distracting music at times brought the experience down. The implausibility of everything that happens and the predictable plot twists make for a film that could have been fantastic but simply lacked power and charisma. Also Sandra Bullock needed to shut the fuck up by the end, nobody wants to hear her babble cliched lines to herself. I know everybody thought it was humanizing, but to me it was just annoying. Also why the fuck does every fictional astronaut have to be so goddamn white?,To anyone who feels lonely and needs a friend: ask cc who I am and message me! Loneliness is one problem we can fix, Claremont. Be mindful, be kind.,Am I the only one who would actually hook up with some of the cuter campus safety officers?,I'm really sorry.

However, I wish that living in a hookup culture wouldn't sacrifice good old fashioned dates. I feel like in college, if a guy likes a girl, he searches for her drunkenly at a dance rather than asking her out and genuinely getting to know her. I am not complaining about hookup culture. Many of us participate in it and clearly people do it because it is enjoyable. But people, don't let that scare you away from asking someone out on a real date once in a while. It's not that scary, and you'd be surprised how receptive most people would be to it. I would much rather go on a date with a guy that I don't know all that well that went out of his way to ask me out than I would dance and hook up with 5 random people at a party. Just saying.,So... ask someone out on a date then?,^ What this person said.,I feel like I'm CMC's least known and yet most eligible bachelor,I, someone who is bi, have feigned being straight and gay in different situations to indicate my disinterest in a person, only so they would immediately be embarrassed for having liked me in the first place...even though I was perfectly elligible,No one has met my standards for complete perfection thus far.

I think I'll go and eat some because I'm so lonely and sad.,Two things:What would happen to the larger black and brown female community if Beyonce just stopped wearing weaves?Also, I hate Nicki Minaj's new song \Lookin Ass,\ not only does it take away from the original by Hotstylez, it seems to defeat the purpose of so many things black and brown POCs have been working to reapproapriate and redefine for ourselves. Especially as other rap artists like Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar are redefining standards of the music. I (didn't watch but noticed) a video with a male artists defending her song and even praising it, but I'm not sure what good there is to find in that song... maybe someone can explain that to me...,This post is extra silly lol. Go away lololololololol.,Any hmc guys need a chill roommate?,Although we attend a liberal arts university consortium that prides itself on its ability to provide a safe space for discussion of topics, I find this consortium extremely Zionist and problematically critical of any other idea of an alternative history.Why is the idea of Orientalism and backwardness seen in other post-colonial discussions, but seen as inapplicable on this topic?,\You cannot illegally immigrate to another country and expect people to deal with it\Two wrongs don't make a right.,Fuck.

Those kinds of siblings are fake ones. Sure, they give you cuddly care packages and constantly verbalize their love for you but jeez, it's such a hoax! Our ways of making friends are much more authentic, and I'm sure many of you would agree. Can I get an Amen to that?,i'm in the frorority at pomona and i've made some amazing real friends in it, and all the frats at pomona do a lot of community service and are active in the college community in a lot of different ways. don't judge greek life just from the more vocal groups at big schools, and from how the media portrays it,I wouldn't personally join a sorority but I completely disagree. How can you judge the authenticity of someone else's relationship, of which you have no experience?,I went to a school where some students had to eat vomit or be peed on to join a fraternity, and they went through with it. I'm happy to no longer be at such a place, as it's hard to respect your peers when you know they've disrespected themselves so thoroughly in search of acceptance to a group. And this doesn't even address how Greek Houses treat outsiders that enter their space...,but the real question is do frats support kale?,You weren't lying, we were both pretending, and I was fine with that.Come back?,I blast Juan Gabriel while outside studying and people randomly stop, stare and laugh.

Great job everyone, really great job.,A kiss is not about imposing your style on your partner, it's about working with them. When you first kiss someone, don't go all out, start with a neutral lip kiss. You have to feel what your partner is like before trying things. Kissing is like dancing, seriously. You can communicate what you like and don't like and so can ur partner without a single word being spoken. The problem is that people are never open to feel these things. Next time you kiss someone try this, be aware and open but also don't feel like you need to conform to their style. Push back gently with your own style when needed and let them know what you enjoy and don't enjoy through your lips. It's easier then you'd think. Also be aware of any signs they are trying to send you.

Love yourself -- you're a beautiful woman of Claremont too!,I find beauty in women's words, not their bodies. I think you're sexy OP. #sapiosexual,To the freshman girl asking about getting with a senior guy:A hookup is fine, but, if you are inexperienced, please be honest about that. It's much easier to teach if I know that teaching is necessary. A guy might also not be interested in teaching. In that case, find a new partner. I wouldn't personally mind teaching a hookup, but, from an investment of effort standpoint, a guy is probably more likely to be willing to teach in the context of a relationship. Now, regarding a relationship. I think a senior-freshman relationship is probably not desirable (for either of you) . The two of you are probably in very different places regarding maturity and life goals (e.g. good grades/extracurriculars vs finding a permanent job or applying to grad school). Further, you've got less than a semester remaining before you will probably never see each other again. Maybe you can make a connection strong enough in the remaining time to justify flights across the country, but to me that seems unlikely. I guess if he will be in driving distance of the 5cs or if one of you has the kind of money such that flights are no big deal, then this changes things.,don't know who this is meant for, but FUCK YEAH calexico is awesome,Is a handjob too much to ask?,Depends on who, when, and where.,Hahahahahshaha,What I miss the most is just kissing you and feeling like we were not only sharing breath, but love all the way to the bottom of our souls.,DON'T ASK ME.....

What is wrong with this place?? Why does no one feel welcome??,So I started talking to this guy I met online from another state that I have never met. As you have heard over and over, as a woman of color in Claremont I do not get much lovin' and there's such a small selection of conscious men of color to date.This guy is the absolute sweetest. He is an artist and is just out of college. He writes me poems and sends me drawings he makes just for me. He shared with me the start of a comic book he is working on. His favorite artists are J Cole, Rakim, and Outkast. He is a black man that knows how to dance bachata. He says he doesn't like music that lacks substance and although I am not sure if his dislike for the weeknd is a bad thing, he says it's because he is old school and only considers keith sweat and old r. Kelly baby making music. <3 He sent me a pic of his afro in the morning and was super self conscious. He is not afraid to show me what he is feeling and says that his mother raised him a gentleman and a feminist as well. He believes he can be a gentleman without undermining the woman. He says that chivalry does not hurt women, being a macho hurts women. He says that he is the way he is because he was raised by a strong black woman and that his stepfather taught him how to express his feeling while still maintaining his manhood. His search for God led him to find forgiveness. He says he hasn't dated in a while because nowadays it seems to be a race between who cares the least. He said the only race he wants to have is who can enrich the other's life faster and who can fall in love faster. He empathizes with the struggle I went through of having to raise three younger brothers with parents that were always working and did not speak English. He gave me this compliment: \I know for a fact that you are definitely a mature, beautiful young lady with the mind of tungsten and the body of pure amethyst.\ <3 <3 <3 I spoke to him for the first time this morning over the phone and had the strongest butterflies I have ever had. He is just the cutest guy and everything I have ever wanted and everything I have NEVER encountered.

Step up, son,[Non-consent]I think I can still give (or not give) consent after I've had some alcohol. I think a lot of people would agree. But this isn't talked about because of the A drunk person cannot give informed consent\\ thing, which is something that I have had personal experience with and believe that it is totally valid.I think we need to talk more about this and get away from the all-or-nothing attitude about consent and alcohol. But I'm worried about bringing it up because I don't want to undermine the validity of non-consent concerns surrounding alcohol. I know it gets into muddy waters because we can't just say \\well after you've had x ounces of alcohol, then consent is revoked\\ because we all have different tolerances and you can't go by BAC because you're not gonna be breathalyzed if you're sexually assaulted/raped AND because the validity of someone's experience shouldn't depend on a number.Shouldn't we talk more about because it's such a grey area? Or are things okay the way they are with us saying you can't consent if you've had any alcohol but ignoring the heaps of people who have consenting sex while drunk?,I don't think many people think that all quantities of alcohol prevent legitimate consent. That said, it is a really confusing gray area. For instance, if you make rape by reason of intoxication solely dependent on the mental state of the person giving consent, then you have weird situations where both partners can simultaneously rape each other. Maybe that's the right solution, but it really destroys the conception of rape where there is a clear victim and a clear perpetrator.,Sometimes I wish I was Asian,New cumshot record!

First, I don't to lose him as a friend because if I ask him, whether he accepts or turns me down, will put a strain on our friendship . Second, it would be awkward because we live in the same hall and I'd be always around him. There's someone else that likes me but I know that I can't move on while I still feel this way about my neighbor. Should I just forget about it and try to move on? I know its strange but I can't talk to the other guy to get to know him better to see if it would work out between us while I still like my neighbor., Is Mufti still a thing?

 You say John Rawls, I say Benjamin Tucker. You say raise taxes on corporations, I say smash their privilege. You say strengthen the state to protect the underprivileged, I say the state inherently protects the most privileged. You say rehabilitation of criminals, I say prison abolition. You say equality, I say liberation. You say liberal progressivism, I say individualist anarchism. n95% of left-wingers these days vote for the same crappy politicians over and over again. If you're one of the 5% dedicated to freedom and equality, like this. Don't let the spirit of the left die.

 Yeah! Like this so Facebook, a $173 billion transnational corporation, can better target you with ads! That'll show 'em.

 The spirit of the left is not anarchism... hopefully XD.

 This is the single greatest intellectual disaster since the Mongols' sack of Baghdad. 

 thoughts on tinder? has anyone had any success? 

 ask Kristi Sun 

 Join tinder and find your soulmate, guaranteed 

 Yeah Melissa and I are a tinder success story 

 There are some gems out there. I definitely got through the entirety of Let It Go by typing it like a conversation and the guy never noticed. 

 Don't mock the magic Kk haha 

 I do ab workouts without a shirt on so I have a direct view of all the fat on my stomach I'm trying to get rid of. 

 Would anyone be interested in seeing Cashmere Cat, Trippy Turtle, and Obey City with me in March? It's during spring break! 

 So fucking tired of all the RADICAL 'feminist' and 'anti-racist' folks (as many of them refer to one another) at the 5Cs. Please keep your illogical prison abolitionist garbage jargon out of my unrelated classes. 

 Or even better, learn the facts instead of dismissing information that conflicts with your hardened worldview. Prisons BREED crime. It's simple statistics, and yes, 
 Lol stfu no 1 care 

 Please take your regurgitated retributionist distortion and sit in a corner while abolitionists ACTUALLY combat crime. 

 My lab partner smells really good... 

 I'm starting to like you a lot! But I don't think you'll ever like me back! :( 

 I honestly could not tell you the names of any of the girls I've had sex with. 

 Been sexually frustrated for a while and at some point I figured I wanted to lose my virginity if only I could find a suitable partner. Even a stranger would do, if he was attractive enough. Then I answered a Craigslist ad, invited the guy over and learned some valuable information about myself. Turns out I am totally not ready if I'm not super into the other person. Sucks for me because everyone I am even slightly into, I'm no good at becoming familiar with. On the upside, Mr. Craigslist was super sweet and he didn't force me into anything. Just, I'm still a sexually frustrated virgin in a conundrum. 

 As a queer woman of color I've had many difficulties connecting with other women on deep romantic levels at the 5C's. It seems like all the women I've talked to only want to use me for sex or want use me as their first lesbian hookup.  Every girl I've been with has found a way to screw me over and then haplessly ignore my existence. My self esteem is lowering every day I'm not sure what to do about it. I just want someone who is willing to be real. 

 :( nI know how that feels... A lot of people really aren't ready for that, which is sad. But I really hope you do find someone. I know I still haven't, but when that person finally comes, it will amazing! So don't give up! <3 

 I have to keep reminding myself: I don't miss you, I miss the person you used to be. 

 Someone please tell me how I can get over a straight girl. She has a boyfriend too. In my rational mind, I know that nothing's ever gonna happen between us, so why am I so hung up about her? 

 You could just vigorously masturbate the feels away. Or maybe gentle masturbation is your style. I dunno OP, I'm not going to tell you how to jerk off 

 Did all of CC's friends automatically  like the new page? Or how are there over 3000 likes in a day? 

 If you were friends with CC before, you were automatically added as liking the page. 

 Now all I can do is lay in my room, Fall asleep, dream of you, Then wake up and do nothing about it  nbeing gay sucks 

 Maybe you should replace that guy in your mind with a guy that might return your affections? (: 

 False, and false --- but it'll stay true as long as you think about it that way! 

 For the record, I faked the orgasms. Both times. 

 Why 

 claremont life is like a triathlon: Runnin train at scripps, cycling through past hookups, drowning in freshmen pussy 

 Ew... 

 I hate how just because I am a black male people assume I am amazing at sports. 

 I'm going to be a new student at CMC next year, but I won't be playing a varsity sport. I know a lot of friends come from teammates, so what is social life like for non-athletes? 

 ahh don't even worry! you will find awesome friends guaranteed. There are so many great people here and whether they play sports or not, you will find a group of friends that you love hanging out with! I don't play sports and I have made soo many friends regardless of that. In my opinion, it's not a big factor at all as long as you keep an open mind and are nice to everyone ! :) 

 Eyyy CMC Class of 2018! ;) nI've heard that about 30% are involved in varsity athletics. I'm sure it's fine if you're part of the other 70%. However, If you feel like you want to try something new, CMC offers intramural sports. (I'm thinking about learning how to play rugby!) 

 I think everybody should prescribe to the 2 gender binaries 

 What's the 2nd gender binary? 

 Prescribe what? 

 lol 

 First, no. Second, I'm pretty sure that this is redundant (binary implies 2). 

 Do you believe me? I bet you don't. I bet you won't... nHe took everything she had kept, and then took everything else that was left. But no one believed her! 

 I have to overload next semester. What is an easy/interesting class that won't require a ton of reading (writing is okay, though)? 

 intro psych.

 Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLI 110 SC) was great. Three papers and a final the whole semester. And i think the majority of the class only read when they had to write. 

 I've actually spent more energy trying to get the cinnamon toast crunch out of the cereal dispenser at frary than I have at the gym this week. 

 the struggle is real 

 drop it like its hot.

 How does one get to Motherfucker? I know the address... But do I drive? Bike? Walk? 

 If you can find people to walk there and back with, walking can be a lot of fun. 

 Last semester there were some people ferrying partygoers by car (for a fairly good price), but walking is not that bad. Don't drive, for your safety and everybody else's, and I'd say don't bike, since I don't think there's any good place to store it there. 

 [Depression] What can I do if I feel depressed and gradually lose control of my life? 

 Reach out to your friends/professors/counselors/RA/Family. Support systems are absolutely essential in these situations. 

 Not all hispanics are religious. Please, stop comming to my door inviting me to prayer/bible study because of my hispanic ethnicity. 

 I totally relate to this. Why has no one from a religious organization come to my room asking for my white roommate? They only ever ask for me. 

 I don't think that was ever the reason. It's mostly to provide a community of Latinos that is genuinely welcoming. CLSA and other Latino organizations still aren't as comfortable as they should be. I know I felt that. But like I said, it's mostly to inform of another resource! :) 

 Senior guys: would you ever date/hook up with a freshman girl? Would you date one or only hook up with her? What's the best way for a freshman to approach you? 

 RELATED CONFESSION: I would when I`m a senior ;) 

 I make up embarrassing fake confessions that sound like they come from people I hate 

 Where are all the hot tattooed chicks? I'm talking 3 or 4 tattoos or more. 

 I have five :) 

 I'm getting there! Tattoos are too damn expensive :'( 

 People don't understand the real purpose of Claremont Confessions. Maybe Claremont Complaints should be a thing.... 

 Confessing your frustrations is still confessing. 

 Go for it. 

 I see the way that you parade your new girlfriend around me as if you want to see the way it affects me. Guess what buddy? A girl knows when it is time to move on. We had a chance to be something but nothing ever came of it. I'm happy that you found someone and while it's taken me awhile to get to this place, I am finally over you so I wish you would let me move on rather than bringing back the past with the glances over at me and showing off your relationship in front of me. I don't know if you really just want to hurt me or you're the one who can't let go of the past.....perhaps you're the one who never got over me. 

 love love love this. Also love that Drew is the picture. 

 You're a lil bitch. Why? Because you put on such a front for your friends, but behind closed doors you crave the dick. And the fact that you can't admit that you like the dick is what makes you lil bitch. 

 Wtf? Seriously, you used to be the best of friends but you're acting hella shady trying to flirt with every guy I've been with. What's the point of it though? I will no longer give you the same courtesy.. But in that case not sure whether I could still call you my friend. Careful, karma is a bitch and so am I. 

 SCANDAL TONIGHT THOUGH!!!! 

 [Non-consent] Two years ago, the night classes ended for winter break, I only gave you consent because I wanted it to be over. I had already told you multiple times that I didn't want to have sex with you. I just wanted to go home. You were coercive and completely took advantage of how drunk I was. nNow, when I hear the wildly aggressive, insensitive, and entitled things you say and realize the depth of your disrespect for survivors, I feel all the more used, disgusting, dirty. It makes me sick that you are well-liked on campus and will go on to be successful in life. It makes me sick that I ever let  you touch me. It makes me sick that I am only now coming to terms with how fucked-up that night was and feeling its effects in full force. Fuck you, you asshole. 

 what a disgusting human being. from what you're saying it sounds like you've put some distance between yourself and this person- good for you. it pisses me off that terrible people can make their victims feel worse about themselves. i'm 100% behind your fuck-you, and if you want someone to be angry with/rant at/talk at, feel free to hit me up. 

 I've been dancing ballroom since last semester and have taken four classes so far, so I've virtually phased out any wow-this-another-person-is-touching-my-body-this-is-awkward feelings a while ago. But for some reason, every time I dance with you I get this dumb smile on my face that just won't go away. It's not even the he can touch me other places ;) feeling, it's the giggly, 5th grade crush sort of feeling. It's m a g i c . . . <3 

 I have 2 midterms the Monday after Coachella/420. Anyone else been in this situation before? 

 No but i have a very simple solution: sell the tickets and study! 

 Same :/ 

 I believe in you. 

 My roommate ate the rest of my gummy vitamins, so I turned off his alarm the night before his huge midterm. An eye for an eye, bitch 

 Eating too many gummy vites is not a joking matter. Citation: a highly credible source, better than Wikipedia

 Stone cold. Damn. 

 That sounds more like an eye for an eyelash 


 My roommate took some of my aspirin before leaving for class today. I probably should've told him that I hide my molly in that aspirin bottle... 

 I sat through a two hour lecture and met with my sociology professor for 30 minutes without realizing that I had a huge dried semen stain on my black shirt. It was my semen too... 

 Really, the only thing preventing me from stealing the giant tub of Nutella from Frank and taking it back to my room is the fact that ants will get into it if I do 

 when/what is motherfucker/where is the event link 

 My hook up was hotter than yours. Checkmate, bitch. Two can play at that game. 

 There are feminists that believe that men should be considered feminist allies, just as straight people are considered allies to the LGBTQA movement. Men do not experience many of the specific injustices and oppressions wrought by sexism, just as white people do not experience the specific injustices and oppressions wrought by racism. nAnother reason that some feminists don't think men can be feminists is that, due to male entitlement and male privilege, male perspective and narrative tends to expand to fill whatever spaces it occupies, which leads to 'male feminists' speaking over female feminists, be it directly mansplaining to women how gender equality 'should' work, or simply having their activism valued more highly than activism from female feminists just because they are male. Reserving the term 'feminist' for women is a way of reserving a conceptual space for the perspectives of women to be heard and respected. nAs for me, I don't care overmuch what our male allies call themselves, but I -do- highly distrust any man who prioritizes his 'right' to the word 'feminist' over a woman's perspective on its proper usage. I think there are valid reasons for a feminist to prefer that a man does not call himself 'feminist', and an unwillingness to concede on that small semantic point indicates to me that he's in it for the ally cookies moreso than providing any real solidarity. 

 Seriously? Yes. The answer is yes. 

 I don't realize how much being stuck in the Mudd bubble has affected me until I try to hang out with my friends from the other colleges and I feel really out of place. 

 Just got my first Claremont Compliment ...aaaaaannnnddd its gone. 

 I used to think I was lonely in Claremont. I didn't know true loneliness until I came here to study abroad. 

 perhaps try looking for pages where expats meet and share information on FB, for example while in Thailand this summer, I met a great friend on what's happening in Mae Sot  FB page! It really helped ease the issue of loneliness, especially if you're in a country that's largely homogeneous and you don't look like them. This was my experience in S.E. Asia 

 Ok, just because you're a senior, don't assume I'm awed by your seniorness and experience. I know you'll graduate in a few months, so you're not looking for anything serious. 

 Ninja sex: trying to have sex with your roommate in the room. 

 I'm always told I'm beautiful in my hometown, when I meet someone that's part of the comments. I look at my pictures and I look great. I have friends here in Claremont and they enjoy my personality, they say I'm funny, smart, classy, and kind. Yet, I feel that the opposite sex does not even notice it here! Haha not that I need the opposite sex's approval, but it would be nice to be acknowledged, to be beautiful in Claremont too. (I know beauty isn't everything, and in the wide spectrum of things it shouldn't even matter, I'm just confessing here) 

 I'm still waiting on that text you promised me that night... 

 i'm looking to get a large-ish, color tattoo (enough to cover a bicep). any suggestions for places in the area, and price ranges? 

 [Non-consent] I lost my virginity without consent. 

 My roommate left me. I think it's because I kicked his ass in 2k too many times. Baby I'm sorry you suck 

 [Rape] I'm a pretty kinky woman, sexually and that's always been fun but in the past few years my sexual fantasies have evolved into really intense and strange. I really get off on the idea of the rape-fantasy  thing, where it's kind of forced sexual encounters, that possibly become more consensual and enjoyable as they progress, but definitely super rough, forced, intense sex, always with more than one guy on one girl (who I imagine is me). The more men, the better. The more degrading and fucked the sexual acts become, the better. And honestly, I don't know if I actually want these things or not (for instance I get way off on men pissing on women, or making them lick their assholes, but Idk if I actually want either of those things, in fact I'm pretty sure I don't), but I crave them to masturbate to, and it's definitely always pretty rapey/humiliating. Is it terrible of me to get off on the idea of rape? I obviously think the actual existence of rape is fucking AWFUL but the concept of it makes me really really hot and I don't know if I should be considering what's wrong with me or not. 

 In rape fantasy, the fantasizer has absolute control. Actual rape is all about the removal of control. It makes -all- the difference. 

 Rape fantasies are actually more common than you think. You are not abnormal in any way--it's common for people to fantasize about the power dynamics associated with rape or a forced sexual encounter. It doesn't mean that you really want to be raped, and it doesn't lessen the horror of actual rape. We all have fantasies, and they are just that: a pleasurable fantasy. Sometimes people will role-play fantasies, such as a rape role-play, but in any good role-play there is always strong consent. In short, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you, and you should be feel absolutely fine about yourself :). 

 It's not terrible for you to have that fantasy. It's actually a quite common fantasy for both men and women. There isn't anything wrong with you to get aroused by those fantasies. Rape fantasy (in concept or played out) and actual rape are very different things. 

 I wish I could wear jeans and t-shirts like most girls. But I feel like I look ugly in them. Instead I always wear these weird outfits that make me feel more confident until I notice that everyone is giving me weird looks because I'm way more dressed up than them 

 Seniors (especially guys) how do you feel about dating/hooking up with freshmen (especially girls)? n Would you hook up with one? Date one? What would the best way for a freshman to approach you be? 

 I have a HUGE DICK. No, seriously, I struggle sometimes walking around campus with this monster. 

 prove it 

 I think the CMC President's son is SO HOT 

 Shockingly enough this wasn't me. I don't need to use an anonymous Facebook page to confess that. Julian did it for me in front of the entirety of CMC last night 

 I would just like to let everyone know that there are rooms surrounding the rose garden at Scripps. Rooms where people sleep. Rooms where people can hear everything that you say as you walk through the rose garden. Now sometimes the conversations I overhear are hilarious and interesting, but in the middle of the night it does get a little annoying constantly being woken up. I would normally just deal with it, but I recently found out that some people at other colleges think that the rooms around the rose garden are classrooms or something so I just wanted to clarify that they are bedrooms so please try to be a little considerate. Thank you :) 

 I spend a lot of time pining over my ex-lovers because it's easier than worrying if that hot Irishman I made out with last weekend will ever text me... 

 Pitzer is falling into the divestment hole. I will offer any Pitzer Senator money to not support the Divestment Campaign at the Claremont Colleges and pass a resolution against it. My dad works for BP. - Fellow CMCer 

 ..... University divestment isn't about the economic impact it makes on huge corporations like BP. If all the colleges in the U.S. divested from fossil fuels right now, we'd barely make a dent in the economy. It's about demanding climate action and beginning the inevitable departure of human civilization from fossil fuel dependence. It's about logic. It's about avoiding impending calamity. 

 lol im pretty sure pitzer divestment would be like 1% of 1% of BP's investors.. unless your dad's job is specifically working with BP!! 

 I'm not sure if what happened was just a weird aberration on a friendship or something else entirely, and I don't know if it will happen again (or how I would feel about that), but I hope you had fun, cause it was pretty chill. 

 On 1/28/13, Claremont Confession was created as a personal user. Today, Facebook forced this to become a page, just like Claremont Compliments. For the time being, CC is going to try this page format out. Please bear with me as I learn the ropes! nContinue to confess anonymously here, Claremont

 Also, this means that all prior confessions have been wiped from Facebook :( I don't have an exact number, but I'm going to guess we had around 8,000-10,000 
 I recommend creating a new personal user page, and telling people to add it. Don't let Facebook tell you what to do.
